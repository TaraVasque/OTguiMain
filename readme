# Order Tracker with Excel Import/Export

This Node.js application allows you to manage orders for a restaurant or shop. You can add, view, edit, delete orders, and even export and import orders using Excel files. Orders are saved both in a `JSON` file for persistent storage and an `Excel` file for easy sharing and data transfer.

## Features

- **Add New Orders**: Input order details including name, price, and type (e.g., "Dine-in", "Takeout").
- **View Orders**: List all current orders.
- **Edit Orders**: Modify existing order details.
- **Delete Orders**: Remove orders from the system.
- **Export Orders to Excel**: Save orders as an Excel file for easy export.
- **Import Orders from Excel**: Load orders from an existing Excel file.
- **Display Total Cost**: View the total cost of all orders combined.

## File Structure

- `orderTracker.js`: The main application file containing the logic for managing orders.
- `orders.json`: A JSON file where orders are saved.
- `orders.xlsx`: An Excel file used for exporting and importing orders.

## Issues, Improvements, and Things to Fix

While the application is functional, there are a few areas that could be improved or added:

### Fixes and Improvements

- **Error Handling for Invalid Excel Files**: Implement better error handling to manage cases where the Excel file structure does not match the expected format.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure that all fields are correctly filled by adding validation for non-empty strings for name and type.
- **Handling Empty Orders**: Handle edge cases properly where actions like "Export to Excel" and "Delete Order" might cause errors if there are no orders.
- **Order Index Fix**: Add validation to ensure that the user is selecting a valid order number (i.e., within the range of the current orders).
- **Refactor for Modularity**: Separate concerns into different functions or files, such as moving Excel-related functions to a separate file or module.

### Features to Add

- **Search Orders**: Add the ability to search for orders based on order name, type, or price range.
- **Category and Status of Orders**: Allow the user to set a status for each order, such as "Completed," "Pending," or "In Progress."
- **Date and Time**: Record the date and time when an order is placed to provide a historical log of orders and allow filtering by date.
- **User Authentication**: Implement a basic authentication system to secure the order data, useful in multi-user environments.
- **Persistent Total Cost**: Save the total cost in the `orders.json` file so that it persists across sessions.
